This project is a free initiative to create an Arduino library for the *Parallax (Futaba) Continuous Rotation Servo*. 
The main goal is to provide a library that simplifies the usage of this particular servo in Arduino projects.

Datasheet: http://www.parallax.com/Portals/0/Downloads/docs/prod/motors/900-00008-CRServo-v2.2.pdf

## Library Usage
 * Download the source
 * Place the ContinuousRotationServo folder in your Arduino1.0+ "libraries" folder
 * Open example sketch: "file", "Examples", "!ContinuousRotationServo", "Rotate" (or "!RotateTime")
 * Connect the signal pin to port 2 (and connect Vcc and GND, ensure Vcc is able to source approx. 200 mA)
 * Compile & upload code
 * The servo should be moving
